# Real world prompting

Welcome to Anthropic's comprehensive real world prompting tutorial. This course is designed for experienced developers who have already dipped their toes into the world of prompt engineering, particularly those who have completed our comprehensive **[Prompt engineering interactive tutorial](../prompt_engineering_interactive_tutorial/README.md)**. If you haven't gone through that tutorial yet, we strongly recommend you do so before continuing, as it provides an in-depth exploration of various prompting techniques with hands-on exercises.

Across five lessons, you will learn how to incorporate key prompting techniques into complex, real world prompts. We recommend that you start from the beginning with the [Prompting recap](./01_prompting_recap.ipynb) lesson, as each lesson builds on key concepts taught in previous ones.
