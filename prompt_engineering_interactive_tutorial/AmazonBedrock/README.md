# Welcome to Anthropic's Prompt Engineering Interactive Tutorial - Bedrock Edition

## Course introduction and goals

This course is intended to provide you with a comprehensive step-by-step understanding of how to engineer optimal prompts within Claude, using Bedrock.

**After completing this course, you will be able to**:
- Master the basic structure of a good prompt 
- Recognize common failure modes and learn the '80/20' techniques to address them
- Understand Claude's strengths and weaknesses
- Build strong prompts from scratch for common use cases

## Course structure and content

This course is structured to allow you many chances to practice writing and troubleshooting prompts yourself. The course is broken up into **9 chapters with accompanying exercises**, as well as an appendix of even more advanced methods. It is intended for you to **work through the course in chapter order**. 

**Each lesson has an "Example Playground" area** at the bottom where you are free to experiment with the examples in the lesson and see for yourself how changing prompts can change Claude's responses. There is also an [answer key](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jIxjzUWG-6xBVIa2ay6yDpLyeuOh_hR_ZB75a47KX_E/edit?usp=sharing). While this answer key is structured for 1P API requests, the solutions are the same.

Note: This tutorial uses our smallest, fastest, and cheapest model, Claude 3 Haiku. Anthropic has [two other models](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/models-overview), Claude 3 Sonnet and Claude 3 Opus, which are more intelligent than Haiku, with Opus being the most intelligent.

When you are ready to begin, go to `01_Basic Prompt Structure` to proceed.
