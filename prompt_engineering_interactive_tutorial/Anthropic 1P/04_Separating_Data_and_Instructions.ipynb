    "Oftentimes, we don't want to write full prompts, but instead want **prompt templates that can be modified later with additional input data before submitting to Claude**. This might come in handy if you want Claude to do the same thing every time, but the data that Claude uses for its task might be different each time. \n",

We called it `ANIMAL` in this example, but just as easily, we could have called it `CREATURE` or `A` (although it's generally good to have your variable names be specific and relevant so that your prompt template is easy to understand even without the substitution, just for user parseability). Just make sure that whatever you name your variable is what you use for the prompt template f-string."
