    "Did you know you can use Claude to **search through Wikipedia for you**? Claude can find and retrieve articles, at which point you can also use Claude to summarize and synthesize them, write novel content from what it found, and much more. And not just Wikipedia! You can also search over your own docs, whether stored as plain text or embedded in a vector datastore.\n",
    "\n",
    "See our [RAG cookbook examples](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/third_party/Wikipedia/wikipedia-search-cookbook.ipynb) to learn how to supplement Claude's knowledge and improve the accuracy and relevance of Claude's responses with data retrieved from vector databases, Wikipedia, the internet, and more. There, you can also learn about how to use certain [embeddings](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/embeddings) and vector database tools.\n",
